# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub
=============================

Welcome to this project. This is my very-first attempt to create a public repository

I have to learn very quickly in order to use this site. I would apreciate your help.

This is the first version. It's only for learn to use this platform. 
Sorry for my bad english.
